# 🔤 Word Guessing Game (Mini Hangman) 🎯

A simple terminal-based word guessing game built using Python. The player must guess the hidden word one letter at a time before running out of attempts!

## 🎮 How It Works

- A random word is selected from a predefined list of 5–8 letter words.
- The player has **6 attempts** to guess the correct letters in the word.
- Each correct guess fills in the appropriate blank(s).
- The game ends when the word is fully guessed or all attempts are used up.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (Standard Library)
  - `random` for word selection
  - `input()` and loops for user interaction

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Save the code to a file named `word_guess.py`.
3. Run it in your terminal or command prompt

##🚀 Future Ideas
- Show previously guessed letters
- Add hints or difficulty levels
- Support full word guessing
